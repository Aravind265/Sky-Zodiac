Info :
A simple weather forecast app. Made with HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript.
Doing this package taught me a lot on how to work with APIs and how to make the page more attractive.
It was an learning opportunity and helped me to get a good grip on Javascript.

Functionality :
The functionality of the app is very simple. You need to enter the place name or the latitude and longitude. The app will navigate you to a weather page where the 
background of the page will be a theme of the current weather of the place. You will also see the temperature and the description. Then you can see the entire details by navigating through. Also you can see the 5 day forecast of the place .
